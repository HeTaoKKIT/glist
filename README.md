glist let you list and edit gist within atom.

1. just toggle on =glist= you'll redirected to your gists folder, and update all your gists into the folder.

2. =cmd-t= to find any gist you wanna edit

3. =ctrl-x ctrl-s= will both save your gist locally and update on gist.github.com

now I can use Atom and gist in place of evernote :beer:
